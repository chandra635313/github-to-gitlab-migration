1. Migrate GitHub to GitLab Using Command Line (Git CLI)
Step-by-step:
Step 1: Clone the GitHub repo
bash
Copy

git clone --mirror https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo.git
--mirror clones all refs, branches, and tags (a complete copy of the repo, ideal for migration).

Step 2: Create a new empty repository in GitLab
Go to GitLab.

Create a new project (without initializing with README).



https://gitlab.com/your-group/your-repo.git
Step 3: Push to GitLab
bash
Copy
Edit
git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.com/your-group/your-repo.git
git push --mirror
This pushes everything (branches, tags, commits) to GitLab.
